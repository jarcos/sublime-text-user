Version 0.2.0 adds support for formatting one or more selections.

NOTE: The selection should be a well-formed fragment of XML! The plugin will
attempt to format non-well-formed XML fragments, but the result is likely to
be wrong.

If you have a fragment of XML selected and run the "Format Markup" command, that
selection will be formatted. Otherwise, the entire document will be formatted.
